Dear Mr. Arvidson,

I am applying for a Data Entry Operator position with your company, this letter is accompanied by my resume for your perusal. I have the skills and attention to detail to make me the perfect person to take on the tasks that I would perform at CACI International, Inc.

I have summarized my qualifications and experience from my attached resume:

•I have over 6 years experience in the data entry business and have been an asset to the companies that I have worked for.

•My ten key touch skills are very fast and I can get through pages of data in just minutes with perfect accuracy.

•I am a highly dedicated employee who is loyal and who will work extra hours when needed as well as weekends if required.

I know that ensuring that all data is input properly is vital to any organization. For this reason, I feel that I would be an asset to any team I am placed on and would be an asset to CACI International, Inc.

A meeting to further discuss my experience would be a benefit for both me and your company. I can be reached by phone by calling (555)-555-5555 or by sending an email to [email]
